Need to:

- Add option to toggle viewing off or on depending on user choice (Found in labchart 2 datamerger)
- Add in blockers and greyed out buttons to prevent people doing things in wrong order
- Check where we do our time guesstimation in "import convert combine"
  as I've seen examples of doing at the start or the end
